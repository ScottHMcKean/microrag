# Micro RAG
A proof of concept for a local retrieval augmented generation (RAG) model. The goal of this repo is to provide a minimal working example of doing a RAG with a 4GB laptop GPU to justify investment in a larger rig.

```bash
python3 -m venv microrag_env
source microrag_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
